Perhaps she’ll die.

There was an old lady who swallowed a cat,
Imagine that to swallow a cat.

Perhaps she'll die.

There was an old lady who swallowed a dog,
What a hog to swallow a dog.

I don't know why she swallowed that fly,
Perhaps she'll die.

There was an old lady who swallowed a horse,
She died of course.
